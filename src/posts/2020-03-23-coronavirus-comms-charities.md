title: "Coronavirus comms for charities"

Coronavirus is dominating world news. Everyone should now be reviewing their ways of working to protect staff, doing risk assessments of the services they offer or their large-scale fundraising events, and also sharing information for the people they support.

Whatever your size of organisation or purpose, you will be meeting to plan how you'll respond internally and externally. There is lots of [noise and misinformation](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/03/battling-coronavirus-misinformation-in-the-age-of-social-media) about the spread of the virus with rumours and blame escalating. What are you doing to reassure your beneficiaries and keep your staff safe?

![illustration of lots of people moving around a big space - maybe on escalators](https://madlinblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/03/covid.jpg)

Here are some useful links and good reads to help you manage your own charity's response.

# Writing about Covid19 for beneficiaries

Information about the virus is changing all the time. Keep an eye on official advice which is being updated on a daily basis and share / incorporate it into your comms:

-   [NHS advice about coronavirus](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/) including an [online symptom checker](https://111.nhs.uk/covid-19).
-   Go to [Gov.uk](https://www.gov.uk/government/topical-events/coronavirus-covid-19-uk-government-response) for updates on the government response. On 16 March, [new advice was added for people who should take stringent social distancing measures](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-guidance-on-social-distancing-and-for-vulnerable-people/guidance-on-social-distancing-for-everyone-in-the-uk-and-protecting-older-people-and-vulnerable-adults).
-   The Department of Health and Social Care have been sharing updates and advice such as [short social media comms about good hygiene](https://twitter.com/DHSCgovuk/status/1234390485382250497) and this [WhatsApp message to share with family and friends](https://twitter.com/DHSCgovuk/status/1236728391069347840) -- "be a handwashing champion".
-   Government have issued advice for [residential care, care homes and supported living](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-residential-care-supported-living-and-home-care-guidance).

[Full Fact](https://fullfact.org/health/wuhan-coronavirus/?utm_source=homepage&utm_medium=trending) are working hard to fact-check lots of the information circulating. Are there any misleading memes or discussions circulating related to your audience or cause? It's worth checking FF's website to see.

Knowing what and when to communicate about coronavirus depends on what type of organisation you are.

If you are a health charity, one working with older people or one with public-access buildings, you may be sharing updates, especially if you are getting lots of helpline calls or forum discussions about risk. As there is so much misinformation circulating, this is your chance to be the go-to authority on the subject for people with specific needs and spreading good advice.

Dan Slee says that "we have all become public health communicators whether we like it or not". In his post ([The basics of communicating the coronavirus](https://danslee.wordpress.com/2020/03/02/share-right-the-basics-of-communicating-the-coronavirus/)), he shares lots of useful tips about making sure your information is factual and shareable. And also notes that your comms need to go where the people are as rumour and misinformation circulate (see [Enlist a team to play whack-a-mole with online rumour](https://danslee.wordpress.com/2020/03/06/coronavirus-comms-youll-need-to-enlist-a-team-to-play-whack-a-mole-with-online-rumour/) and [How covid is playing out in Facebook groups](https://danslee.wordpress.com/2020/03/12/viral-message-heres-how-coronavirus-is-playing-out-in-facebook-groups-so-you-can-connect-with-them/)).

# Examples

Here are some examples of information charities have created for the people they represent:

-   Charities representing people with underlying health conditions listed in the Government's latest advice quickly responded by updating their information. This [Twitter Moment](https://twitter.com/i/moments/1239892855189012480) includes examples from Asthma UK, Diabetes UK, Bloodwise and others.
-   Older people are one of the at-risk groups. [Age UK](https://www.ageuk.org.uk/) have been sharing updates via social media and have a prominent link on their homepage to their [Age UK advice page](https://www.ageuk.org.uk/information-advice/health-wellbeing/conditions-illnesses/coronavirus/).
-   19 cancer charities shared information under the [One Cancer Voice](https://www.teenagecancertrust.org/get-help/coronavirus) group.
-   If specific information about the implications of the virus on the health condition you represent hasn't been released, issuing a statement to say that, is better than saying nothing. See this [tweet from Tiny Tickers CEO Jon Arnold](https://twitter.com/jonmarnold/status/1235604764290883585).
-   Hospitals and care homes are issuing guidance about visiting. [Hospice UK](https://www.hospiceuk.org/what-we-offer/clinical-and-care-support/coronavirus-guidance) have shared links to statements from 13+ hospices across the country. (They also took part in a [video call of 200 hospices](https://twitter.com/madlinsudn/status/1238415503795896322) to share plans and best practice -- love this!)
-   Information is available in alternative formats. [Sign Health](https://twitter.com/SignHealth/status/1237377120927711233) have produced a video using British Sign Language and subtitles to share information with deaf people. [Mencap](https://www.mencap.org.uk/advice-and-support/health/coronavirus) and [Down Syndrome Ireland](https://twitter.com/DownSyndromeIRL/status/1235958320982183936) have produced easy-read guides.
-   [Doctors of the World](https://twitter.com/DOTW_UK/status/1238522765692612609) have translated information into 21 languages. The Government have produced [information about self-isolation and social distancing in Arabic, French, Mandarin, Cantanese, Polish and Welsh](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-guidance-on-social-distancing-and-for-vulnerable-people).
-   [Mental Health Foundation](https://mentalhealth.org.uk/publications/looking-after-your-mental-health-during-coronavirus-outbreak) shared information about looking after your mental health during an outbreak and [Mind wrote about coronavirus and your wellbeing](https://www.mind.org.uk/information-support/coronavirus-and-your-wellbeing/), focussing on planning ahead for self-isolation.
-   [Young Minds](https://youngminds.org.uk/blog/what-to-do-if-you-re-anxious-about-coronavirus/) produced information for young people as have [Young Scot](https://young.scot/campaigns/national/coronavirus).
-   Self-isolation tips from [Campaign to End Loneliness](https://www.campaigntoendloneliness.org/blog/coronavirus-and-social-isolation/).
-   New: [Cruse](https://www.cruse.org.uk/get-help/coronavirus-dealing-bereavement-and-grief) have written a whole new section about dealing with bereavement and grief at this time.

-   Good Things Foundation released information about accessing digital healthcare -- to support people who may have to do this for the first time due to the virus. [Using the internet to get ready for coronavirus](https://www.goodthingsfoundation.org/areas-of-work/health-and-wellbeing).

# Comms tips

Think accessibility -- not everyone can read the text on an image. If you are sharing images with text on via social media, include a link to a web page where the same information can be read and/or repeat the text in your post. I have seen so many covid statements which are just images of text with no link (and probably no alt text). See more from [@CovidAccessInfo](https://twitter.com/CovidAccessInfo/) (new account set up on 19/3).

Make information easy to find. Pin your tweets. Use hashtags (#covid19UK / #coronavirus etc). Clearly layout information so it is easy to read. Add the story to your homepage.

![Tweet from Bloodwise UK. Very clear layout. Hashtags and signposting to sources of help.](https://madlinblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/03/bloodwisetweet.jpg?w=600)

Only ever link to one page which you are keeping up to date. As the situation develops you don't want people to be seeing old advice. They may be seeing old posts or looking at old emails but at least you'll know they can click through for current information. Avoid PDFs for the same reason.

Clearly indicate information you have added or changed. You might do this at the top of your web page or by highlighting what has been added. See this example from [Cystic Fibrosis Trust](https://www.cysticfibrosis.org.uk/news/coronavirus-qa).

Even if you don't have infomation you have produced yourself, at this stage it is probably a good idea to have a page about coronavirus on your website which links to the key sources of information and something about the services you offer if there are changes to them. A quick random search found lots of charity websites showing no covid results in their searches.

![Website search results: says no items found](https://madlinblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/03/covidsearchresults.jpg)

Don't include information about the current number of cases or deaths. This instantly dates your information and shows that it is not up-to-date.

As the situation develops, you may need to use more effective and urgent ways to communicate your messages. Plan ahead now. Are you able to use video or audio or other methods to respond to a crisis comms situation? Might you need to devote your entire homepage to the story? Can you send out mass emails to your stakeholders? Are your crisis comms processes up-to-date? See this [thread from Gemma Pettman sharing crisis comms planning tips](https://twitter.com/GemmaPettmanPR/status/1235164392506916865).

Check your scheduled messages. For example, do you have messages scheduled which are promoting events which are likely to be cancelled? Be aware that the situation could change over the coming days / weeks.

There may be a chance to stand out with some warmer comms:

-   [Oxfam](https://twitter.com/oxfamgb/status/1237642007604088833) made a lovely hand washing video.
-   [LGBT Foundation](https://twitter.com/LGBTfdn/status/1235550813495472128) also shared an alternative mantra to wash your hands to.
-   [Shakespeare Theatre Company in America](https://twitter.com/ShakespeareinDC/status/1234965741817991168) shared lines from Macbeth.
-   Monster Supplies -- the shop from Ministry of Stories -- promoted their [tins of escalating panic product](https://twitter.com/MonsterSupplies/status/1235475771327754240).
-   Make your own office handwashing poster using [Wash Your Lyrics](https://washyourlyrics.com/).

It's useful to see other organisations' internal plans if you need to write one yourself. Some have shared theirs publicly:

Reassuring staff and volunteers that you are prepared is key. Internal comms must play a vital role. What internal comms systems do you use? Do they work to reach everyone? There is some good advice in this post by [Rachel Miller of All Things IC](https://www.allthingsic.com/where-to-get-accurate-information-about-covid-19/).

What about your events or meetings? Many are being cancelled / postponed or changed to online. [Bond](https://www.bond.org.uk/events/conference-2020) announced the cancellation of their annual conference.

# Digital service delivery

What does the situation mean for the services you run and the support people in your community might need? What might you need to do more of or change?

For example, can you move face-to-face services , online? What different services could you offer to expand to support people through a scary and challenging time? Are you able to run digital events or make fun content to entertain?

-   New: [open source guide to digital service delivery for charities](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pgVtqrjT5DvLzyE1F5oltVFdPXtAdJSPmiNcFYvQzFc/edit#), created by Third Sector Lab and SCVO. Includes examples and best practice.

![Community Action Response - 5 steps](https://madlinblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/03/communityactionresponse.jpg)

If you are a community volunteering charity, how are you keeping volunteers in touch with how they might be needed? And reassuring them about measures you'll be taking to protect them?
