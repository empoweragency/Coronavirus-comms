title: "What do we need to do to protect staff, volunteers and visitors?"
---

-   Information: Provide clear information using communication channels including posters and email. 
-   Handwashing facilities: Handwashing facilities should be available and well supplied. More regular handwashing may require more supplies. Provide hand sanitiser, tissues and cleaning products around your buildings for staff and visitors. GOV.UK has published clear and printable [instructions on handwashing techniques](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/866065/Handwashing_techniques.pdf) (PDF, 130KB) which can be displayed around the workplace.  
-   Cleaning regimes: Viruses can live on hard surfaces for up to eight hours. Frequently clean key areas including keyboards and door handles. 
-   There is government advice on [social care](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/guidance-for-social-or-community-care-and-residential-settings-on-covid-19/guidance-for-social-or-community-care-and-residential-settings-on-covid-19), [homecare](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-residential-care-supported-living-and-home-care-guidance/covid-19-guidance-on-home-care-provision) and [educational](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/guidance-to-educational-settings-about-covid-19/guidance-to-educational-settings-about-covid-19) settings you may want to review if they apply to your organisation. 
-   Review travel arrangements. The government are strongly advising the [avoidance of all non-essential travel on public transport](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-guidance-on-social-distancing-and-for-vulnerable-people/guidance-on-social-distancing-for-everyone-in-the-uk-and-protecting-older-people-and-vulnerable-adults). Are there possible alternatives such as video conferencing? Maintain updated and clear advice for staff travelling. 
-   Ensure emergency contact details are up to date.
