-   Wash your hands often with soap ([or soap substitutes](http://www.eczema.org/coronavirus)) and water for at least 20 seconds or use an alcohol-based hand sanitiser. This is particularly important after taking public transport. 
-   Use an alcohol-based hand sanitiser that contains at least 60% alcohol if soap and water are not available. 
-   Cover your cough or sneeze with a tissue, then throw the tissue in a bin. You can [download a 'Catch it, Bin it, Kill it' poster](https://www.england.nhs.uk/south/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2017/09/catch-bin-kill.pdf) (PDF, 940KB) for your workplace from the NHS. 
-   Clean and disinfect frequently touched objects and surfaces in the home and work environment. 
-   Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands. 
-   Government advice is to reduce social interaction between people. The advice includes the [social distancing measures](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-guidance-on-social-distancing-and-for-vulnerable-people/guidance-on-social-distancing-for-everyone-in-the-uk-and-protecting-older-people-and-vulnerable-adults) we should all be taking, including working from home where possible.
